AUV tools by Ian Katz (ijk5@mit.edu)

A web interface designed to sit on an AUV and provide a direct interface to recorded data.

This website is meant to be installed on an AUV, and assumes that you have 
a mysql server on the AUV as well.  Further, it assumes that the database 
records data in the proper format (see attached schema file).

This code is currently lacking excessive comments, and the KML generation needs to be
revamped.

Built and tested on Ubuntu Linux; all documentation will assume that OS.

In order to install MOOS-web-gui: 
 0. you will need to apt-get install the following (and maybe more):
      php-mdb2-driver-mysql (pulls in php-pear, php-mdb2, and php5-mysql)
      apache2
 1. set your web root (the htdocs directory) in the sites-available file
 2. remove the default symlink in /etc/apache/sites-enabled and put the MOOS one there:
        cp _etc_apache2_sites-available_moos /etc/apache2/sites-available/moos
        cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
        rm 000-default
        ln -s ../sites-available/moos ./000-moos
 3. modify your php include path (in php.ini) to includes this php directory
    include_path = ".:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear:/PATH/TO/MOOS-web-gui/php"
 4. modify php/report_dbinit.php to give the location of your mysql db
